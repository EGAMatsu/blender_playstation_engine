This source code is a mixture of different portions taken from various vendors.
So the exact license for it is kinda complicated. However, one thing is for
sure: you are allowed to use this project for free, in any commercial product,
without tainting your commercial code's license in any way. However, you need
to mention that this project is part of your product, and if you change the
source code, you need to distribute the changes.

TLDR: this is a non-reciprocal open source license, but you still have to
mention the fact you're using this project.
