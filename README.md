# blender_playstation_engine
An attempt to make the Blender Game Engine for PlayStation 1 compile.

# The Goal
So, back in the 90s, when the creator of blender had the company NaN, the company worked on a Blender Game Engine runtime for the PlayStation 1, [which you can get here.](https://download.blender.org/source/chest/neogeo/playstation_engine/)

Only issue, the devs behind it modified the PSYQ library and did a bunch of hacks, PLUS the repository is missing files, so it can't exactly compile out of the box.

I am hoping members of the PSX Development community can help make the engine run.

For now, changes that could make the engine unstable/broken are permitted, as long as it gets it to compile and link, then after, the engine should be polished up and put back into a fully functional (or whatever condition it was when released) state.

# Current Progress
All source files compile, but cannot link fully.\
[Here is the logs from the last compile with a different outcome.](https://pastebin.com/raw/ubR7jAMB)
