# blender_playstation_engine
An attempt to make the Blender Game Engine for PlayStation 1 run.

# The Goal
So, back in the 90s, when the creator of blender had the company NaN, the company worked on a Blender Game Engine runtime for the PlayStation 1, [which you can get here.](https://download.blender.org/source/chest/neogeo/playstation_engine/)

Only issue, the devs behind it modified the PSYQ library and did a bunch of hacks, PLUS the repository is missing files, so it can't exactly compile out of the box.

I am hoping members of the PSX Development community can help make the engine work with full (or with near full) functionality.

# Current Progress
Completely compiles and links and launches, but immedately crashes.
